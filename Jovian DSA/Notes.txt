Notes for Jovian DSA course

Systematic strategy to apply for solving problems

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input and output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix any bugs
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity (time/space) and identify inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6

"Applying the right technique" is where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms comes in handy
