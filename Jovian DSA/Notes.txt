Notes for Jovian DSA course

Systematic strategy to apply for solving problems

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input and output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. Explain to yourself it in plain English
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix any bugs
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity (time/space) and identify inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6

"Applying the right technique" is where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms comes in handy

"Signature" is a structure of the function without any content, need to put in "pass" if function is empty
